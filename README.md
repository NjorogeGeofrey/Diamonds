# Linear Regression Analysis
## Introduction
This R script performs linear regression analysis using synthetic and real-world datasets. It includes simple linear regression with a clear linear relationship and multiple linear regression using the diamonds dataset.

## Project Structure
linear_regression_analysis.R: The R script containing the linear regression analysis code.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the analysis.

### Required Packages
corrplot: For correlation plot visualization.
ggplot2: For data visualization.
tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization.

### Usage
Load the required packages using library() commands.
Run the analysis code in linear_regression_analysis.R to perform linear regression on synthetic and real-world datasets.
View the output visualizations and analysis results.

### Analysis Steps
Simple Linear Regression:

Generate synthetic data with a clear linear relationship.
Visualize the data using a scatter plot.
Perform simple linear regression analysis.
Multiple Linear Regression:

Load the diamonds dataset and explore its structure and summary statistics.
Perform correlation analysis between variables.
Create bar plots to visualize the relationship between categorical variables and the target variable.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build and evaluate a multiple linear regression model using the training set.
Visualize the model residuals using a histogram.

## Assumptions and Considerations
Linear Assumption: The model assumes a linear relationship between input and output variables.
No Noise: Outliers are removed to reduce noise in the data.
No Collinearity: Highly correlated input variables can lead to overfitting; consider addressing collinearity.
Normal Distribution: Transform variables if they are not normally distributed to improve model reliability.
Rescaled Inputs: Consider using scalers or normalizers for more reliable predictions.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the linear relationships within the datasets.
Model performance metrics, such as R-squared and p-values, are included in the regression summary output.
Visualizations, including scatter plots, bar plots, correlation plots, and residual histograms, help interpret the data and model performance.
